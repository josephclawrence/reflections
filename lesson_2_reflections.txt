How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the staging area is a git construct. It is different form the working directory in that it is not a real folder with files. It is different from the repository in that it is not a git store of files and folders
It allows us to be more granular over what files to add and then commit to a repository at any time, since we might want to include only specific files as part of a commit, since they might be logically separate from other files at that stage.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
only add files to the staging area that are logically grouped
