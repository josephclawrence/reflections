What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it adds some git related metadata in a .git folder, which tells git the status etc.
You need to do it so that git can start keeping track of everything

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the staging area is a git construct. It is different form the working directory in that it is not a real folder with files. It is different from the repository in that it is not a git store of files and folders
It allows us to be more granular over what files to add and then commit to a repository at any time, since we might want to include only specific files as part of a commit, since they might be logically separate from other files at that stage.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
only add files to the staging area that are logically grouped

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When you are working on a new feature, or potentially a new version of the software, but you don't want to change the main branch

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
You can see which commits are part of each branch's history easily, and whether a particular commit might be lost if not committed to a newly created and checked out branch

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
the lines from each of the two versions of the files are combined according to the merge logic, to try and make the most meaningful combination
the branches merge as per the diagram, because the branch into which another was merged becomes the new tip of that branch, and the old
all commits from the histories of both are now subsumed under the merge target.
