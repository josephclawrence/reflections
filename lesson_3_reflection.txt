When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you want to be able to collaborate easily with others
If you want to keep a safe store of your codebase

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Other people could commit changes that you do not want to be a part of your local repo

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is an exact copy of a repo, with all commit history. This is if you copy a remote to local, or a local to local.
A fork is the same as a clone pretty much, except it is done from a Github repo to another Github repo, and maintains the record of authorship and attribution.
Branches are within on repo, and represent different streams of commits that could be used for new feature developments and so on. They can be merge together at any stage.
