When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you want to be able to collaborate easily with others
If you want to keep a safe store of your codebase

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Other people could commit changes that you do not want to be a part of your local repo
